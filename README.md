# piggy-bank
Remember those childhood days when we use to collect coins within house, take a few cents from mom, and store it into piggy bank? Slowly and slowly we have save a good amount which we are proud of I am applying the same thing for links. So the basic idea is to store different links into different files based on their categories. This will be a CLI tool which will allow us to add, remove, list links based on categories, open links and display links (all or on based on categories). That's all this does one thing that is manage your links !!
